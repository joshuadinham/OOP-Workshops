One of the concepts covered in this workshop includes namespaces

I learned to define namespaces by using the namespace keyword following by the identifier and keeping pertinent  
structs, functions, and variables within those brackets in order to have them be accessed outside of the file

To use the name space I used "using namespace" followd by the identifier namespace I wanted to use.

I also utilized modular programming in order to create and test each individual part of the program seperately. 
The user input associated functions were separated and tested within the UI program.
The GPAList associated functions were separated and tested within the GPAList program.
All File related functions were separated and tested within the GPAList program.
and finally the main.cpp program was used to test all other components of the program when needed by using #include.

The most difficult part of the program was determining the flow of the program. I fixed this by using pseudo-code before writing the program. 
Another difficult section of the program was opening and reading the file. I fixed this by carefully testing the file related commands used in the Movie program 1 at a time and incomporating it into my code.

Another difficult part of the program was sorting the list of students once I was able to properly read the file.
I fixed this by learning bubble sort and sorting by stno.

All in all I learned alot and refreshed alot of my memory from last semester and I feel like I'll be able to tackle the next workshops alot faster and with more accuracy.
